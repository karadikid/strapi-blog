# Introduction

This repository exists to test [creating a static-blog with gatsby and strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/build-a-static-blog-with-gatsby-and-strapi). It precedes the development of a static subscription blog on IPFS.

## Technologies

This sample includes:

- Strapi

* sqllite

- Gatsby

* React

## Next Steps

The next steps include creating a framework potentially using Gatsby and Jekyll or other such tooling to allow for easy deployment of static websites to IPFS.

### Learning Notes

I thoroughly enjoyed rediscovering my React knowledge and combining it with the latest GraphQL.

It helped me to understand:

- GraphQL Querying and Nodes
- Formatting of returned data and props
- React Components and Layout in Gatsby
- React Templating in Gatsby
